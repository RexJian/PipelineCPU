# PipelineCPU
Design a typical 5-stage pipeline MIPS CPU. When the CPU receives a command, it divides the command into five stages: Instruction Fetch (IF), Instruction Decode (ID), Execution (EX), Data Memory Access (MEM), and Write Back (WB). The CPU is composed of an ALU, an adder, data memory, instruction memory, a program counter (PC), and so on.
